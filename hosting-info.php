<h3 id="get">What you Get</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A subdomain like this: <b>yoursitename</b>.punkfairie.net</li>
	<li>Space to upload your website files</li>
	<li>FTP login and instructions for setting up FileZilla</li>
</ul>

<p>The server has PHP installed as well if you like to use that!</p>

<p>Space is unlimited but <i>please don't abuse this!!</i> Having lots of images and files for
download is ok, but please do what you can to compress things (not making images bigger than they
need to be, zipping files, etc). If you need help with this please let me know, I'm happy to
assist!</p>

<p>If my hosting costs jump up by a lot and I see that you have loads of unneccesary giant images or
unzipped files, I will warn you and remove them. If it continues I will kick you off if neccesary.
Please don't make me do so! I much prefer to be nice. <i class="smile"></i></p>

<p>Each person only gets one subdomain at first, requests for second subdomains will be on a
case-by-case basis and not considered until you've had your first one at least two months. This is
to keep things simple for me, and so I can make sure you won't abuse my generosity <i

<h3 id="rules">Rules & Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li><i>RULES:</i></li>
	<li><b>No sites with adult media.</b> I don't care if you post erotic fiction or talk about your
	life as a sex worker (psst I'm one ;) ). But unfortunately thanks to <a
	href="https://stopsesta.org/" target="_blank">SESTA/FOSTA</a> and the risk of accidentally
	hosting illegal content, I can't allow adult media on sites I host. Sorry!</li>
	<li>Please do your best to make sure <b>downloads are virus free.</b></li>
	<li><b>Don't abuse the unlimited hosting space</b> - zip downloads and don't make images bigger
	than they need to be.</li>
	<li><b>All sites must be personal and ad-free</b> -- basically, nothing that is intended solely
	to make you money. This means that art portfolios you show to potential clients are fine (the
	site doesn't directly generate income by itself) but webshops and ad-filled SEO blogs are
	not.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><i>REQUIREMENTS:</i></li>
	<li><b>You must know at least basic html.</b> There is no website builder, you will be uploading
	website files from your computer. You don't need to be a pro web designer! I just need to know
	you understand the basics of making a website. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
	target="_blank">W3Schools</a> is a great place to learn if you don't know anything!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="server">About the Server</h3>

<ul>
	<li>OS: Ubuntu 20.04</li>
	<li>Webserver: Apache2</li>
	<li>PHP: 8.1.3</li>
	<li>Hosting: DigitalOcean</li>
	<li>Domain: NameSilo</li>
</ul>

<p>punkfairie.net is hosted on a <a href="https://digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean
droplet.</a> Which means I installed and configured the webserver myself! All DO does is provide the
space and a fresh Ubuntu install. I've spent a lot of time learning about running webservers, and
have been tinkering with my own little servers for close to 10 years, but I am NOT anywhere close to
an expert.</p>

<p>The point of this is, I've done what I can to make sure everything is working correctly, but at
the end of the day I'm still an amateur and have no support team. It's very possible something may
break and it may take me a while to fix it. *knock on wood* that shouldn't happen, but <b>by choosing
to keep your site here you acknowledge that I do not guarentee everything working perfectly.</b></p>

<p>Since you'll just be uploading html or php files and not running any crazy web apps or something,
the chance that something will break is very, very tiny, bar me going crazy and attempting a server
overhaul without a backup lol :p I just put this info here as a disclaimer!</p>
