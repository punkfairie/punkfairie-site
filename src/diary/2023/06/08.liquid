title: Moving to Neocities
---
<p class="u-rainbowifyChildren">
    Finished the new rainbow layout today! I'm moving the site to Neocities for the social aspect, and because PHP isn't
    allowed there I switched over to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" class="Link">Eleventy</a> - a
    static site compiler.
</p>

<p>
    I redid the layout from the ground up with the intention of making it mobile friendly, but it's not a priority and
    I'm not even going to look at what the site looks like on mobile lol.
