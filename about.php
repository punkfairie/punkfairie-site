<h3>Domain</h3>

<p>Punkfairie.net was registered on February 24, 2022. The name <i>punkfairie</i> has been my
username for various online communities since high school (I first came up with it for my Tumblr
url).</p>

<p>The current layout was almost entirely coded by me, the only things I didn't code are the section
borders, and the mouse pointer trail script. Everything else was done by me. In addition, I also run
the server myself on a <a href="https://digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean droplet.</a>
The only thing preinstalled was Ubuntu 20.04, everything else was installed and configured by
me!</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Marley. I've been tinkering with websites since grade school, mostly making
Petz fansites. I had a brief period of running fanlistings in high school as well. I have always
enjoyed the creativity of designing a website, and figuring out how to make things like custom hit
counters.</p>
